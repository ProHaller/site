## Hi

Iâ€™m Roland HALLER, and Iâ€™m glad you're here to share a bit of my journey.
Now, who am I, is always a tricky question as Iâ€™ve worn a lot of hats, and not only to hide my bald head.
From first a lumberjack to currently a creative director, through acting, facilitation, and interpretation,
I have learned to be a wide variety of me in as many cultures, and contexts.

I've spent the last 10 years living and working in Japan.
I'm a multilingual communicator, and educator, fluent in French, English, Japanese and more recently Rust.

The thread that binds all these experiences together is, ADHD and an overactive curiosity,
but also a deeply rooted thirst for knowledge, understanding, and growth, to an arguably unhealthy degree.

### Iâ€™m currently working on

- **Changing careers, again** \
  I am looking for a job as an engineer and multi-context collaboration facilitator.
  Ideally in Rust to leverage both my limited technical skills and my much more extensive communication, ideation and problem solving expertise.
  I'm open to start working more of less immediately and willing to relocate if need be.
  So, don't hesitate to contact me about potential collaborations.
- **Teaching Education Technology** \
  I teach young Japanese university students in Osaka how to leverage technology to learn, and teach more effectively.
  Including, but not limited to:
  - Large language models
  - Information design
  - Public speaking
  - Relationship design
- **Creative Director** \
  For the past 4 years, I have been working with the amazing people at Tsunagaru Inc.
  My role is mostly focused on problem solving, experience design, and ideation.
  With some engineering here and there as the sole tech-savvy employee of our company.
- **Ingesting and Producing Rust content** \
  ðŸ¦€ Nom nom nom nom ðŸ¦€

### Things I am passionate about

- **Rust** \
  I made a very intentional if quite uncommon choice to choose Rust as my first programming language.
  Some would argue it is too hard for beginners, I obviously have a lot of thoughts about that.
  Personally, I see it as arguably the best language to build solid software engineering foundations.
  You disagree? Good, let's talk about it!
- **Rationality and Empathy** \
  Yes, both. I passionately believe that we can, and should, strive to our best in at least those two categories.
  Doing so build a better world, forgetting one is potentially disastrous.
- **Perfumes** \
  Well, I'm French you know... ðŸ¦¨
  To be fair, I like beauty and talent in many shape and forms.
  But, there is much attention given to the visual, auditory, and culinary arts, but rarely do we explore fragrance with the same care.
  Well, I do.

## What is this blog?

As I started to interview for diverse positions, I realized that I have done a lot,
but I have rarely taken the time to document and showcase any of it. This is an attempt to rectify this oversight.
I will try to put into words, images, and links, my work, thought and ideas for all to see.

The content in this blog is limited by the time, energy and motivation I find to write it.
If you enjoy it or find it valuable contact me and tell me as much. I like encouragements.
Enjoy!
