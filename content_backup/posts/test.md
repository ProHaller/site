## 4 Phases of Learning

### Discovery / Input

#### Goal

The goal of this section is to expose the learner to a new content. There may not be understanding yet in this phase, as the learner discovers the subject. This phase serves to frame the following study with a curated organization of the content.

#### Format

The input phase is all about providing content, no matter the format it takes. It is often structured and relatively passive media, text, video, recording, presentation, Observation, etc.

#### Best Practices

A good input generally includes:

1. A little bit of context
2. Overview of the subject and where it fits in the learner's map of knowledge
3. Definitions of key concepts
4. Boundaries on what is out of the scope of the subject
5. Presentation of Key facts and pieces of information about the subject. (

> [!NOTE] Some information may be intentionally elided for the learner to discover them on their own.

#### Exercises

1. Given a subject the learner is familiar with list a few possible inputs following the best practices above.
2. Given an arbitrary input on something the learner is **not** familiar with, identify the content for each of the points above and if any are missing.

### Understanding / Internalization

#### Goal

The goal of the internalization phase is **understanding**. _Understanding_ can be defined in many a way, I refer here to the following, non exhaustive list:

- **Semantic understanding:** identify and clarify unfamiliar terms, concepts. Understand **what** is being said.
- **Relational understanding**: Integrate new information into the learner map of knowledge. Understand how this is related to what they already know.
- **Self awareness**: The input is rarely enough to get an accurate picture of the full subject. Understand the unclear areas of the subjects. Doubts, implications, missing information, etc.

#### Format

The internalization phase **needs** to happen within the learner's mind as its purpose is to anchor the content in their world view. Some support scaffolding can be provided however:

- Glossary creation: List important terms and concepts
- Lateral explanation, where the learner's try to summarize and explain what they just learned.
- Summarization of the content
- MindMap of the subject, etc.

#### Best Practices

A good internalization generally includes:

1. References and documents perusal
2. Taking notes of the content at the current understanding level
3. Listing and trying to answer questions about the dark areas of the subject

> [!WARNING] Do not try to get a full grasp of the subject at this stage. Aim for an accurate view of the state of your understanding and lack thereof.

#### Exercises

1. MindMap the content and all you can relate to it.
2. List as many questions as possible on things you don't understand or know.
3. Try to explain the subject in your own words to highlight things you don't fully understand.

### Appropriation / Targeted Practice

#### Goal

The goal is two-fold here:

1. **Target** any weak **specific part** in your understanding or skill and devise a method to improve it.
2. Incrementally combine specific skills into bigger units and **practice for fluidity**:
   1. Quality
   2. Completeness
   3. Ease
   4. Speed

#### Format

- The practice should be **short and numerous**. The goal is not to overwhelm, but to **accumulate successes**.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Divide any skill or knowledge into the smallest possible issue and practice this in isolation.
- **Adapt to the subject**: Retrieval for memorization, Targeted search for information, timed output for speed, listing and mnemonics for exhaustiveness, etc.

#### Best Practices

- **Start small**: each exercise should last less than 1 or two minutes at first.
- **Embrace Repetition**: Don't stop after solving one problem once, practice them at least 5 by five until you are regularly successful and feel unchallenged.
- **Correctness first, then speed**: Only augment speed once you can reliably succeed at the individual exercise.

#### Exercises

- Design small exercises with explicit target for a subject you are familiar with.
- Design a progression of targeted exercises for a subject you are struggling with.

> [!NOTE] This is abstract, isolated practice. The goal is to go through the motions. Like a Kata in martial arts.

### Application / Output

#### Goal

This last part of the learning cycle is an application of the skill to any kind of practical application. It aims to use the acquired skill it a **real** situation. The confrontation with a real situation or production, will highlight a lot of quirks in your understanding / skill, it will also make the effort to acquire the skill worthwhile by making it tangible.

#### Format

This should be as tangible as possible:

- A written report
- An exposition
- A competition
- A public presentation
- An article
- etc.

#### Best Practices

The best practices depend heavily on the subject. There are however some things to aim for in the application:

- Make it as real as possible. Maybe by including real information, real situations or issues, etc.
- Involve others: Whether you show your production, contribute to something or organize something, accountability toward other people will greatly deepen the skill integration

#### Exercises

- Try to identify what could an application of that skill be. How to make it public? How to make it seen? How to make it relevant?
- Identify where a newly acquired skill is actually used in the real world.
